## About
> The Learning Tools AI Playground is a docker environment designed for experimenting with Moodle and various AI systems. It integrates Moodle and Moodle-Docker as submodules, facilitating the automatic loading of other Moodle plugins upon request. The AI aspect of the playground includes a series of plugins supporting vector stores and local or remote Large Language Models (LLMs), offering scalable and customizable AI experimentation within Moodle.

This repository allows for a number of Moodle AI resources to be loaded quickly and reliably for testing and evaluation.
