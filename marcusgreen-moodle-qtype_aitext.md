## About
> This Moodle question type accepts free text which is then evaluated by a remote Large Language Model AI system such as ChatGPT.

A teacher provides a prompt to define how the text submitted by a student should be evaluated. A marking scheme for the model to observe can be specified as well.

The student's text and the prompt are passed to an LLM model and evaluated, with the resulting AI generated feedback and grade being assigned to the question attempt.
