## About
> This plugin provides a fully functional AI backend. It can be used as alternative choice for the AI subsystem which is being shipped with Moodle 4.5. The AI manager provides the key feature of being a multi-tenant AI backend which is the main reason you should be using this plugin for providing AI functionality in your moodle instance instead of the moodle core AI subsystem.

Probably the most full-featured alternative to the core Moodle AI sub-system, this plugin supports a range of LLM providers, and a wider range of "AI Purposes" (roughly equivalent to Moodle's AI Actions).
